***CSR Helper*** is a simple application based on [AngularJS Material](http://material.angularjs.org/) and [PKIjs](https://pkijs.org) that aims to make it easy for users to generate certificate requests (PKCS#10s) for requesting SSL certificates.

You can find this project hosted here: https://csrhelp.pages.dev

### What does it look like?


The ***CSR Helper*** application helps users generate a certificate requests for :

*  OpenSSL
*  Exchange (2007 and 2010)
*  Java Keytool
*  F5 Big-IP
*  IIS


It supports both ECC and RSA certificate requests and will use use [WebCrypto](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/) and [PKIjs](https://pkijs.org) to directly generate keys and certificate requests if the browser supports it.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone `main` branch from the
[CSR Help](https://github.com/ss-o/csrhelp.git) repository and install the dependencies:

Clone the csrhelp repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/ss-o/csrhelp.git

#### Install Dependencies

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.
